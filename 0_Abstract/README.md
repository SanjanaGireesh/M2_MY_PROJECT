# ABSTRACT
Battery Monitoring System for electric vehicle has been developed for monitoring battery level using LCD. It was designed on a low cost microcontroller. Voltage, current aretransferred to microcontroller, and then data of battery is transferred using embedded technology on display. Battery monitoring is displayed on LCD display. The monitoring system was able to show real-time data of voltageand parameters in LCD display simultaneously.
